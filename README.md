# Hey there 👋  
I'm Jomar!

🎯 Right now I'm building **YankeeScope** — a full-stack app that tracks and breaks down New York Yankees player stats and game data. Think of it like a custom dashboard for die-hard Yankees fans (like me) ⚾.

This project is 100% built from scratch using React, Node, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL — because why not make something fun *and* technical?
